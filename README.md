# SortScope — Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

SortScope is an interactive web application that visualizes sorting algorithms in real time. It helps understand how sorting algorithms work internally through animated bars, live statistics, and algorithm insights.

## Purpose

This project was built to make algorithm learning intuitive through visualization. Instead of reading static pseudocode, users can observe how algorithms compare values, perform swaps, and gradually reach a sorted result.

---

## Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

---

## Roadmap

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Algorithm comparison mode
- Sound feedback
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Mobile responsiveness
